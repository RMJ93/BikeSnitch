In 2012, 160 bike thefts occurred at UCI and only ten cases in which bikes were recovered have been reported. In 2013, 109 bike thefts occurred and only five were recovered. The total number of bike thefts in 2014 is not known yet, but from January 2014 to June 2014, 53 bike thefts occurred and only six bikes have been recovered. Although the number of bike thefts have decreased at UCI, the recovery rate of the bikes are very appalling. From the history given, it is clear that our product, BikeSnitch, is needed. Other products only focus on either bike retrieval or anti-theft and UCIPD only attempts to decrease bike thefts through educating the public of how to properly lock a bike. Our product aims to incorporate both a retrieval and an anti-theft system in order to further decrease bike thefts and increase bike recoveries.\r\n  \r\n## The Team  \r\n**Raul Madrigal Jr**: Computer Engineer, Team Captain    \r\nBluetooth Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer  \r\n    \r\n**Juan Meza**: Electrical Engineer, Team Member    \r\nPower Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer  \r\n   \r\n**Davis Vang**: Computer Engineer, Team Member    \r\nGPS Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer     \r\n   \r\n  \r\n## Senior Design Advisor:  \r\nProfessor Pai Chou  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n## UCI Special Design  \r\n* Bluetooth Proximity Detection  \r\n* 100 % Self- Powered  \r\n* Device Focused on Bike Recovery  \r\n  \r\n## Tentative Schedule  \r\n**January 4, 2015:**  \r\n* Assess the overall design and how parts will be integrated onto the bike for part ordering  \r\n* Order needed parts by end of the week  \r\n* Gather data on crime rates for stolen and lost bikes  \r\n\r\n**January 11, 2015:**  \r\n* Make sure all parts are delivered and received  \r\n* Assemble and review design overview in order to make any necessary changes  \r\n* Review module of electrical components   \r\n\r\n**January 18, 2015:**  \r\n* Start programming and designing the software  \r\n* Have working prototypes of key elements: generator, bluetooth, and GPS tracker  \r\n\r\n**January 25, 2015:**  \r\n* Integrate working prototypes to work together\r\n  \r\n**February 1, 2015:**  \r\n* Measure maximum energy storage  \r\n* Measure the power consumption and battery life of prototype  \r\n* Make changes if necessary based on measurements  \r\n* Report data based on measurements  \r\n  \r\n**February 8, 2015:**  \r\n* Debugging and optimization  \r\n  \r\n**February 15, 2015:**  \r\n* Continue debugging and optimization process \r\n \r\n**February 22, 2015:**  \r\n* Use case testing and report results  \r\n\r\n**March 1, 2015:**  \r\n* Debug and make final preparations for final submissions \r\n \r\n**March 8, 2015:**  \r\n* Presentation to panel  \r\n* Submit final report  \r\n  \r\n## Updates  \r\nUpdates to Come!
