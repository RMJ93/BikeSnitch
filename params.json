For our project we will be designing a bike lock that integrates Bluetooth connectivity, GPS tracking, and a renewable power source. Our projectâ€™s goal is to reduce the crime rate of stolen bicycles by preventing and locating them.  \r\n  \r\n## The Team\r\n**Raul Madrigal Jr**: Computer Engineer, Team Captain    \r\nBluetooth Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer  \r\n    \r\n**Juan Meza**: Electrical Engineer, Team Member    \r\nPower Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer  \r\n   \r\n**Davis Vang**: Computer Engineer, Team Member    \r\nGPS Subsystem Design and Integration Engineer     \r\n   \r\n  \r\n## Senior Design Advisor:  \r\nProfessor Pai Chou  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n## UCI Special Design  \r\n* Bluetooth Proximity Detection  \r\n* 100 % Self- Powered  \r\n* Device Focused on Bike Recovery  \r\n  \r\n## Tentative Schedule  \r\n**January 4, 2015:**  \r\n* Assess the overall design and how parts will be integrated onto the bike for part ordering  \r\n* Order needed parts by end of the week  \r\n* Gather data on crime rates for stolen and lost bikes  \r\n\r\n**January 11, 2015:**  \r\n* Make sure all parts are delivered and received  \r\n* Assemble and review design overview in order to make any necessary changes  \r\n* Review module of electrical components   \r\n\r\n**January 18, 2015:**  \r\n* Start programming and designing the software  \r\n* Have working prototypes of key elements: generator, bluetooth, and GPS tracker  \r\n\r\n**January 25, 2015:**  \r\n* Integrate working prototypes to work together\r\n  \r\n**February 1, 2015:**  \r\n* Measure maximum energy storage  \r\n* Measure the power consumption and battery life of prototype  \r\n* Make changes if necessary based on measurements  \r\n* Report data based on measurements  \r\n  \r\n**February 8, 2015:**  \r\n* Debugging and optimization  \r\n  \r\n**February 15, 2015:**  \r\n* Continue debugging and optimization process \r\n \r\n**February 22, 2015:**  \r\n* Use case testing and report results  \r\n\r\n**March 1, 2015:**  \r\n* Debug and make final preparations for final submissions \r\n \r\n**March 8, 2015:**  \r\n* Presentation to panel  \r\n* Submit final report  \r\n  \r\n## Updates\r\nPut Finished Pictures Here  \r\n  \r\n***\r\n\r\n### A UCI Senior Design Idea By:  \r\nRaul Madrigal Jr.   \r\nJuan Meza   \r\nDavis Vang   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n***\r\n  \r\nFor Any Questions Please Contact us at **bikesnitch@gmail.com**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
